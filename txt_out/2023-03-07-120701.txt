this is a test of the printer that is now going in script i think
this is the same printer but now it is in the Roman font
this is it now in the sans SERIF font to see what it is like
this is the same and now it is in the courier font for sure
this is the same again but now it is in the prestige font
i am going to go with the sans serif font for the moment i like that one 
best and it works for me so i will do the lines that i have in that font 
and we can see what happens while the world goes by and the rest of the workld 
can go ahead and kiss my hairy ass!
