# python typewriter
 write to epson line printer like typewriter

using python and curses to create a tyewriter like interface\
and sending the final line to a file and/or a line printer\
that uses the ESC protocol

requires:\
python 3.10+ ( uses case keyword )\
escpos python library 1.9 from https://pypi.org/project/escpos/ and\
https://python-escpos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

curses (built in)

At this point I have added all i need, the rest if just polish and\
stupidity checks, there are some more features that could be added\
like tabs and some housekeeping stuff, ini file loading so that\
the state is persistent when the program is started but they are\
relatiely trivial and i will not learn much from doing them again
